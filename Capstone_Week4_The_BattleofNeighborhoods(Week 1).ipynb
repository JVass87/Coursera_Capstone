    "Madrid is the capital and most populous city of Spain. The city has almost 3.3 million inhabitants and a metropolitan area population of approximately 6.5 million. It is the second-largest city in the European Union (EU), surpassed only by Berlin, and its monocentric metropolitan area is the second-largest in the EU, smaller only than Paris. It is also very famous for its gastronomy and \"tapas\" culture. A tapa is an appetizer or snack in Spanish cuisine and translates to a small portion of any kind of Spanish food. Tapas may be cold (such as mixed olives and cheese) or hot (such as chopitos, which are battered, fried baby squid). In some bars and restaurants in Spain and across the globe tapas have evolved into a more sophisticated cuisine and can be combined to make even a full meal. The importance of this tradition is even more striking when we are are looking at the growing international tourism visiting the Community of Madrid from 2001 to 2018:\n",

Moreover knowing the weak spots in the center areas can also be a good opportunity to open a new bar and fill the market niche."

    "• Data will be also sorted based on rankings to help the recommendation and get rid of the restaurants which dont have any ranking information.\n",

    "• Finally the best rated neighbourhoods will be visualized to see the most attracting areas or potential market niches."
